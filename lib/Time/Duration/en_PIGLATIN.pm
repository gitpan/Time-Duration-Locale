=head1 NAME

Time::Duration::en_PIGLATIN - fun pig Latin time durations

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Time::Duration::en_PIGLATIN;
 print "next update ",duration(150),"\n";
  # prints "2 inutesmay andway 30 econdssay"

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Time::Duration::en_PIGLATIN> is a silly variant of C<Time::Duration>
returning duration strings in pig Latin (igpay Atinlay).  It can be used
directly, or via C<Time::Duration::Locale> with language setting
"en_PIGLATIN".

=head1 EXPORTS

Like C<Time::Duration>, the following functions are exported by default

    later()       later_exact()
    earlier()     earlier_exact()
    ago()         ago_exact()
    from_now()    from_now_exact()
    duration()    duration_exact()
    concise()

The exports follow C<Time::Duration> at run-time, so anything new there is
automatically filtered and exported.
