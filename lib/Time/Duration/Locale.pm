=head1 NAME

Time::Duration::Locale - time duration string chosen by user's language preferences

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Time::Duration::Locale;
 print "next update ",duration(150),"\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Time::Duration::Locale> has the same interface as C<Time::Duration> but
chooses a language according to the user's locale settings.

As of July 2010 available language modules on CPAN include

    Time::Duration        English
    Time::Duration::fr    French
    Time::Duration::ja    Japanese
    Time::Duration::pt    Portuguese
    Time::Duration::sv    Swedish

If the user's locale setting is not one of these then the fallback is the
English module.

=head1 EXPORTS

Like C<Time::Duration>, the following functions are exported by default

    later     later_exact
    earlier   earlier_exact
    ago       ago_exact
    from_now  from_now_exact
    duration  duration_exact
    concise

=head1 EXTRA FUNCTIONS

The following extra functions are provided by C<Time::Duration::Locale> and
are not exported.

=over 4

=item C<Time::Duration::Locale::setlocale ()>

Set the language from the current locale environment variables etc.  The
current implementation uses C<I18N::LangTags::Detect>.

This is done automatically the first time one of the duration functions is
called.  But call it explicitly if you change the environment variables etc
later and want C<Time::Duration::Locale> to follow the new values.

=item C<$lang = Time::Duration::Locale::language ()>

=item C<$module = Time::Duration::Locale::module ()>

=item C<Time::Duration::Locale::language ($lang)>

=item C<Time::Duration::Locale::module ($module)>

Get or set the language to use, either in the form of a language code like
"en" or "ja", or a module name like "Time::Duration" or
"Time::Duration::ja".

C<undef> means a language has not been chosen yet.  When setting the
language the necessary module must exist and is loaded if not already
loaded.

=back

=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

C<LANGUAGE>, C<LANG>, C<LC_MESSAGES> etc, as per C<I18N::LangTags::Detect>.
